Upgrading SOLR:
- Download latest SOLR ZIP/tar file.
- Copy the example folder into KeywordSearch/release and name it solr-version.  The example folder has Jetty configured to launch SOLR.
- Commit the code to get a baseline of the original version (to make our changes more obvious).
- Refer to previous version upgrades for what to modify, but here is the current list:
-- Update jetty.xml to specify 127.0.0.1 to listen on instead of 0.0.0.0
-- Update solr/solr.xml to not start a core automatically. 
-- Update solr/collection1/conf/schema.xml (copy based on old version)
- Update Server.java to use the new solr-VERSION path that the examples folder was opened into.


Upgrading solrj:
- solrj is configured with ivy.
- Upgrade version needed in ivy.xml
- Change the wrapped jar libraries in Netbeans to refer to the new jar file versions.
